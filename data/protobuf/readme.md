## Protocol Buffers protos

* The data encoding is defined in `pulsewaves.proto`.

* To generate Python module from the proto, use `scripts/generate-plswvs-proto.sh`. This is only required if the proto is modified.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

* [Proto 2](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v2.6.1) is used for compatibility with UMSUITE.
